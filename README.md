Scopes
======

###What is Scopes?

Have you ever tried to set up scoped `ObjectGraphs` with Dagger and failed miserably? Scopes is a compile time annotation processor that is here to help!

###What does Scopes do?
It allows to separate portions of your `Application` in logical "flows". It generates "`BaseActivity`s" that contain common dependencies that other `Activities` that are part of the same flow could use.

###What the hell are you talking about?!
Here is an example. Let's say that your `Application` has a login/signup flow (i.e. a screen with a login button, a another one with an "Enter username and password", etc). It is really likely that `Activities` that are part of this flow will have common dependencies (i.e. an `AuthenticatorService.java`,`LoginErrorDialog.java`, etc). Scopes allows you to define a `BaseActivity` that contains all these shared dependencies.


###Ok, got it, how do I use it?
It all starts by defining a class that is Annotated with `@DaggerScope`; it does not need to be an `Activity`. If you decide not to annotate your `Activity`, the class annotated with `@DaggerScope` has to be in the same package as the `Activity` that extends the generated `BaseActivity` (huh?!... Look at the `app` module and you will see what I mean).

```java
@DaggerScope(baseActivityName = "BaseLoginFlowActivity", retrofitServices = GithubService.class,
    restAdapterModule = RestAdapterModule.class, butterKnife = true)
public class LoginFlow {}
```

`baseActivityName` is the name you want to give to the parent `Activity` (it should be distinct for all `BaseActivities`)

`retrofitServices` takes in an array of `Class` `Objects` that are the retrofit `interfaces` you have defined

`restAdapterModule` is a `Module` that contains a provider for the `RestAdapter` to be used to create the `retrofitServices`

`butterKnife` it is an optional field that tells `Scopes` to wire up `ButterKnife` on the `BaseActivity`.
    
**Once you build your project**, `Scopes` will generate `BaseLoginFlowActivity.java` with the following content: 

```java
package me.emmano.scopes.app.login;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import dagger.ObjectGraph;
import butterknife.ButterKnife;
public abstract class BaseLoginFlowActivity extends Activity {
  @javax.inject.Inject
  protected me.emmano.scopes.app.services.GithubService githubService;

  private ObjectGraph scopedObjectGraph;
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(getLayout());
    ButterKnife.inject(getActivity());
    scopedObjectGraph = ((me.emmano.scopes.app.ScopedApplication)getApplication()).getObjectGraph().plus(new me.emmano.scopes.app.login.BaseLoginFlowActivityModule()).plus(getModules());
    scopedObjectGraph.inject(this);
  }
  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    scopedObjectGraph = null;
    super.onDestroy();
  }
  protected abstract Object[] getModules();
  protected abstract Activity getActivity();
  protected abstract int getLayout();
}
```

As you can see `Scopes` creates `BaseLoginFlowActivityModule.java` that contains `@Providers` for the `retrofitServices`. This class uses the `RestAdapter` you provided to `@DaggerScope` to create the `retrofitServices`. If you did not provide a `RestAdapter`, `Scopes` assumes your `Application` `Class` has a module that will provide a `RestAdapter`. You will have to add `@ApplicationGraph` to a `public` method that returns the `Application`'s `ObjectGraph`. In any way, you have to supply a `RestAdapter` one way or another.  (more about `@ApplicationGraph` below)

```java
package scopes;

import services.GithubService;
import retrofit.RestAdapter;
@dagger.Module(injects = me.emmano.scopes.app.BaseLoginFlowActivity.class, includes = modules.RestAdapterModule.class)
public class BaseLoginFlowActivityModule {
  @dagger.Provides
  public GithubService providesGithubService(RestAdapter adapter) {
    return adapter.create(services.GithubService.class);
  }
}
```
    
### This is all fine and great, but what else do I have to do?
Now, you have to make your `Activity` extends the `BaseActivity` generated by `Scopes`; in this case it will be `BaseLoginFlowActivity`. You will have to implement a couple methods, in this case:

```java
protected abstract Object[] getModules();
protected abstract Activity getActivity();
protected abstract int getLayout();
```

Here is a basic example of a class that extends `BaseLoginFlowActivity`:

```java    
package me.emmano.scopes.app;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import android.widget.TextView;

import java.util.List;

import butterknife.InjectView;
import modules.ActivityModule;
import retrofit.Callback;
import retrofit.RetrofitError;
import retrofit.client.Response;
import me.emmano.scopes.app.BaseLoginFlowActivity;
import services.Repo;


public class MainActivity extends BaseLoginFlowActivity {

    @InjectView(R.id.text)
    protected TextView textView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        textView.setText("Eureka!");
        githubService.starGazers(new Callback<List<Repo>>() {
            @Override
            public void success(List<Repo> repos, Response response) {
                for (Repo repo : repos) {
                    Log.e(MainActivity.class.getSimpleName(), repo.getLogIn());
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void failure(RetrofitError error) {

            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected Object[] getModules() {
        return new Object[]{new ActivityModule()};
    }

    @Override
    protected Activity getActivity() {
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    protected int getLayout() {
        return R.layout.activity_main;
    }
}
```

There is one last thing for you to do. `getModules()` gives you the option to add extra dependencies to be used just in this class (namely, `MainActivity`). The most simplistic implementation of a `Module` could be as follows:

```java
package modules;

import dagger.Module;
import me.emmano.scopes.app.login.MainActivity;
import scopes.BaseLoginFlowActivityModule;

@Module(injects = MainActivity.class, addsTo = BaseLoginFlowActivityModule.class)
public class ActivityModule {}
```
    
Please note `addsTo`. Unfortunately, you will have to manually add the `Module` to which we are plus()sing. This will always be the `Module` generated by `Scope` that is injected on the `BaseActivity`; `BaseLoginFlowActivityModule` in this case.

### What if I want Scopes to use dependencies from my Application's ObjectGraph?!
That is what `@ApplicationGraph` is for. Let's say you have dependencies that are common to your whole application (i.e. a `Bus`, a `RestAdapter`, etc) and you want your scoped graphs to have these dependencies; after all, this is what scopes are about. How do I do it? here is how:

```java
@ApplicationGraph(applicationModule = ApplicationModule.class)
public ObjectGraph getObjectGraph() {return objectGraph;}
```
You can name this method whatever you like, but it must be public and reside inside your `Application` class. `ApplicationModule` is the module that contains the `@Providers` for dependencies that are common for the whole `Application`

### TODO
Tons of refactoring. Kittens are currently dying due to some code on the `ScopeProcessor` class.

Add a parameter to `@DaggerScope` that allows passing an `Classes[]` to be injected on the `BaseActivity`. Right now, only `Retrofit` services can be injected. You can currently add these dependencies to your version of `ActivityModule`, add the corresponding `@Injects` and `extends` your version of `MainActivity` to get regular `Objects` other than `retrofitServices` injected. It is hacky and nasty, I know.

###Installation
Just add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:
``` gradle
implementation 'me.emmano:scopes:0.1.5'
apt 'me.emmano:scopes-compiler:0.1.5@jar'
```
`Scopes` requires the `apt` plugin. You can add it easily by adding this to your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.4'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'android-apt'
```

Lastly, add this inside `android{}` in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'
}
```
For more help setting up `Scopes` you can look at the `app` sample module.
